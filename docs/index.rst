Astronomical Dendrograms in Python
==================================

The ``astrodendro`` package provides an easy way to compute dendrograms of
observed or simulated Astronomical data in Python.

About dendrograms
-----------------

The easiest way to think of a dendrogram is to think of a tree that represents
the hierarchy of the structures in your data. If you consider a
two-dimensional map of a hierarchical structure that looks like:

.. image:: schematic_structure_1.png
   :width: 300px
   :align: center

the equivalent dendrogram/tree representation would look like:

.. image:: schematic_tree.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: center

A dendrogram is composed of two types of structures: *branches*, which are
structures which split into multiple sub-structures, and *leaves*, which are
structures that have no sub-structure. Branches can split up into branches and
leaves, which allows hierarchical structures to be adequately represented. The
term *trunk* is used to refer to a structure that has no parent structure.

Mapping these terms back onto the structure gives the following:

.. image:: schematic_structure_2.png
   :width: 300px
   :align: center

For an example of use of dendrograms on real data, see `Goodman, A. et al
(2009) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Natur.457...63G>`_.
